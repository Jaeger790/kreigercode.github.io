            <h2 class="AboutCats">General info</h2>
            <p class="aboutText">The domestic dog is an extremely social animal and offers a diverse variety of choices
                as there are well over 300 breeds recognized by the World Canine Organization. Adopting a dog offers
                mutual benefits between dog and owner. Many studies cite the social benefits of having a companion as
                well as the reduced feelings of loneliness from adopting a dog. Studies even show medical indicators
                such as <a class="linkItem"
                    href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.119.005554">reduced blood pressure and
                    improved lipid profiles</a>. If you have a dog, it is important to make sure that you care for your
                dog; be mindful of what you feed your dog and provide enough opportunities for exercise. In this page,
                you will find more information about how to care for your pets throughout the various stages of their
                lives.</p>

            <h2 class="ageHeader">Diet & Excercise</h2>
            <p class="aboutText">Throughout dogs’ lifespans, they should generally be fed fewer meals as they mature.
                Puppies should be nursed the first two months, then introduced to three meals per day when they are
                about three to six months years old. Their food intake should be reduced to two meals per day when they
                are six months to one year old and finally reduced to one meal after they reach one year old. And a
                dog’s typical body mass is composed of somewhere between 60 and 70 percent water. The <a
                    class="linkItem" href="https://www.aspca.org/">ASPCA</a> says just a 10 percent decrease in body
                water can cause illness, and a 15 percent loss can cause death, so make sure you keep your pooch
                hydrated!
            </p>
            <p class="aboutText">
                Much like humans, dogs need to have a healthy level of activity to keep their organs healthy, as well as
                sun and fresh air. The minimum recommended time for exercise varies greatly with breed and size
                differences, but generally a range of <strong>30–120 minutes of exercise is recommended per
                    day!</strong> Can you imagine exercising two hours per day? OK, I know that wouldn't bother some of
                you reading this. But the thought of it to me makes me cringe! And by the way, exercising your dog does
                not mean you are being challenged to a push-up contest. Brisk walks are OK too! You can also choose from
                a variety of toys to encourage physical activity; just be sure they are age appropriate and do not pose
                a choking hazard. Pay careful attention to toys that require supervision.
            </p>

            <h2 class="ageHeader">Grooming and Handling</h2>
            <p class="aboutText">Keeping your furry family member clean is important to its health. So be sure to brush
                frequently to reduce the amount of shedding and prevent matted and tangled fur that can prove to be
                extremely difficult to remove.
                <strong>Check for insects such as ticks and fleas, especially after visiting heavily wooded
                    areas.</strong> Bathing is not only important to your dog’s health but can be an exercise depending
                on how strong willed the dog is. Rinse all of the soap out, as any residual soap can result in a rash.
                <strong>Be sure the soap is formulated for your puppy or dog, since harsh soaps can cause allergic
                    reactions.</strong> And as always, be careful how you handle your loved one. No matter the size of
                your dog, you need to be cautious as you carry your canine. If you have a small dog, then cradle the pup
                with one hand under the chest and the forearm supporting the back half. If it is a large dog, reach
                under the belly with both your arms perpendicular to the dog, and use each arm to support the chest and
                rear as you lift.
            </p>

            <h2 class="ageHeader">Vaccinations & Medications</h2>

            <p class="aboutText">
                You should always consult with your veterinarian, but there is a core set of vaccines that are typically
                recommended. Vaccines that reduce the exposure risk to things such as hepatitis, rabies, and parvovirus.
                Others may be determined by your vet depending on the environment in which the dog resides. Some of
                these include <a class="linkItem"
                    href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/general-pet-care/vaccinations-your-pet">Bordetella
                    bronchiseptica, Borrelia burgdorferi, and Leptospira bacteria</a>.
