     <p>This was a trail I noticed the last time I was here in Oct 2022. The trail appeared to be connected to another area with hills to climb.  Once we got through the first section of the trail, it became apparent that this was not the right way. </p>
    <br>
        <p>There was only a cliff to go down, a rougher hill to climb back up, in the opposite direction, or continue going straight into the bush.  The day was getting late and my arms were noncompliant from exhaustion  </p>
            <br>

            I was not ready for this, though I desperately wanted to be.  This was exactly the type of riding that I had grown to love.  Grueling technical obstacles with a bit of risk for not completing the obstacle correctly. I however, was not there to do the same type of riding. I have access to enduro style riding all year round where I live. I needed to take advantage of the parts of the park I could not replicate at home. It was time to leave the cliff trail.</p>
