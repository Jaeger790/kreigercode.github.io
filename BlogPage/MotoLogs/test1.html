    <p>This was a trail I noticed the last time I was here in Oct 2022 and it looked like it connected to the area that I wanted to try to ride next.  However, once we got through the first section of the trail, it became apparent that this was not for the feignt of heart. </p>
    <br>
        <p>There was only a cliff to go down, a rougher hill to climb back up, or continue going straight into the bush.  The day was getting long and my arms were already obliterated from the ride up until that point...  </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            I was not ready for this, though I desperately wanted to be.  This was exactly the kind of riding that I had grown to love.  Grueling technical obstacles with a bit of risk for not completing the obsctacle correctly. Alas, I was not there to do the same type of riding that I have access to all year round where I live, so I needed to take advantage of the unique featuires of the park to extract the most from the experience...  It was time to leave the cliff trail. </p>

    <div class="description"><p>Next up was Elbow trail. It is not a long trail but has a fun little hill to climb towards the end of it, shown in the video.  At the top of the hill there is access to some good single track trails that are carved into the hillside. A lot of these trails also have burms big and sweeping enough to really rail them and get in a rythm.  It is a much different style of trail riding than going in the forest, where the natural trails are not groomed, filled with rocks and roots, and no obvious line paints the fastest way through.</p></div>
