                    This is going to be a development journal for developing my
                    first GUI controlled piece of software using JavaFX. The
                    project is an inventory management program that will be able
                    to add, modify, and delete items from associated tables
                    called Parts and Products.
                </p>

                <p class="entryP">
                    This is the first GUI program I have ever created and have
                    been excited to get started. The class tied to this project
                    is C482 Software 1. The learning environment is zybooks.
                    <a href="https://www.zybooks.com/">Link for zybooks.</a> I
                    have heard a lot of bad reviews of zybooks from fellow
                    students. They seem to opt for alternative learning
                    platforms to teach themselves the language. I donâ€™t seem to
                    have the same issues with it. The one issue I could see is
                    the programming environment for solving problems on the site
                    does not offer any syntax correcting or code prediction
                    suggestions. The code predictions I can understand not
                    including, but syntax checking is essential for swifter
                    debugging.
                </p>

                <p class="entryP">
                    Since the language is all new to me I am going to begin the
                    project by going through the materials and learning about
                    the unique characteristics of the language. After I feel
                    competent enough to get myself into trouble, I will begin
                    designing the first screen for the program.

            <div class="entryContent">
                <p class="entryP">
                    I worked through all of the basics of the material covering
                    up to classes and inhertiance and I felt like getting my
                    feet wet with practicing what I learned. I started by
                    working on the home screen for the Inventory program and
                    quickly realized how close fxml is to xml. The naming
                    comparison is balatently obvious, but for some reason, I
                    still did not expect the actual design of the langauge to be
                    so similar. I feel like I understand now why the school
                    taught me html and css. Not only is it a good way to get
                    those new to coding to think more programatically, but it is
                    also still relevant in modern software development. I also
                    learned in the last few days that dotNet also directly
                    utilizes markup language and a model/view/controller concept
                    for design. I am confident that this is going to expedite my
                    learning of java and I feel like I understand software
                    design a lot better overall now.

                <p class="entryP">
                    Here is my finished design of the home screen. I have not
                    added any logic to the program yet, so this is basically a
                    super high fidelity wireframe for what the final product
                    will look like.

                <h5>Color</h5>
            </div>
                <p class="entryP">
                    I don't think my color usage is something that I would put
                    into production on real products I develop. I do like color
                    for my personal projects because it helps visual distinguish
                    different focus points on screen. Using the muted colors
                    also prevents the color from becoming distracting and
                    drawing attention away from what the user is actually trying
                    to accomplish on screen. My color choice is an attempt to
                    create a forest theme.

                <h5>Button Placement</h5></div>
                <p class="entryP">
                    I placed the exit button in red on the bottom right of the
                    program for a specific reason. I recently completed a UX
                    class and had to submit a website I developed for review by
                    peers. No one that reviewed my website ever found the
                    question mark icon at the bottom right of the page that
                    wouold have led them to the FAQ page. I did color the
                    question mark blue, so I want to determine if it was color
                    or button location that led people to not see it. Other than
                    wanting to experiement with this idea, I don't particularly
                    like the location of the exit button.
                </p>
            
                <p class="entryP">
                    I wanted the add, modify, and delte buttons to resemble the
                    old gameboy start and select buttons. I think I got the
                    shape close but the color of the original buttons are too
                    dark to work with black text so I chose to just utilitze the
                    shape.

                <div class="subHeader">
                <h4>What next</h4></div>
                <p class="entryP">
                    Next I want to work on getting the add buttons to
                    successfully open a new window and display a new styled page
                    for adding parts and adding products. This will be my first
                    time working with Event handlers and opening new windows.
