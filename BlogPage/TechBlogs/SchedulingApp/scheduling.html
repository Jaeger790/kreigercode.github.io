                My first project utilizing

                This is going to be a development journal for developing my
                first GUI controlled piece of software using JavaFX. The
                project is an inventory management program that will be able
                to add, modify, and delete items from associated tables
                called Parts and Products.
            </p>

            <p class="entryP">
                This is the first GUI program. The class tied to this project
                is C482 Software 1. The learning environment is zybooks.
                <a href="https://www.zybooks.com/">Link for zybooks.</a> I
                have heard a lot of bad reviews of zybooks from fellow
                students. They seem to opt for alternative learning
                platforms to teach themselves the language. I donâ€™t seem to
                have the same issues with it. The one issue I could see is
                the programming environment for solving problems on the site
                does not offer any syntax correcting or code prediction
                suggestions. The code predictions I can understand not
                including, but syntax checking is essential for swifter
                debugging.
            </p>

            <p class="entryP">
                Since the language is all new to me I am going to begin the
                project by going through the materials and learning about
                the unique characteristics of the language. After I feel
                competent enough to get myself into trouble, I will begin
                designing the first screen for the program.
