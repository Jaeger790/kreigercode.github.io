                This is going to be a development journal for developing my
                first GUI controlled piece of software using JavaFX. The
                project is an inventory management program that will be able
                to add, modify, and delete items from associated tables
                called Parts and Products.
            </p>

            <p class="entryP">
                This is the first GUI program I have ever created and have
                been excited to get started. The class tied to this project
                is C482 Software 1. The learning environment is zybooks.
                <a href="https://www.zybooks.com/">Link for zybooks.</a> I
                have heard a lot of bad reviews of zybooks from fellow
                students. They seem to opt for alternative learning
                platforms to teach themselves the language. I donâ€™t seem to
                have the same issues with it. The one issue I could see is
                the programming environment for solving problems on the site
                does not offer any syntax correcting or code prediction
                suggestions. The code predictions I can understand not
                including, but syntax checking is essential for swifter
                debugging.
            </p>

            <p class="entryP">
                Since the language is all new to me I am going to begin the
                project by going through the materials and learning about
                the unique characteristics of the language. After I feel
                competent enough to get myself into trouble, I will begin
                designing the first screen for the program.

        <div class="entryContent">
            <p class="entryP">
                I worked through all of the basics of the material covering
                up to classes and inheritance and I felt like getting my
                feet wet with practicing what I learned. I started by
                working on the home screen for the Inventory program and
                quickly realized how close fxml is to xml. The naming
                comparison is blatantly obvious, but for some reason, I
                still did not expect the actual design of the language to be
                so similar. I feel like I understand now why the school
                taught me html and css. Not only is it a good way to get
                those new to coding to think more programmatically, but it is
                also still relevant in modern software development. I also
                learned in the last few days that dotNet also directly
                utilizes markup language and a model/view/controller concept
                for design. I am confident that this is going to expedite my
                learning of java and I feel like I understand software
                design a lot better overall now.
            </p>

            <p class="entryP">
                Here is my finished design of the home screen. I have not
                added any logic to the program yet, so this is basically a
                super high fidelity wireframe for what the final product
                will look like.

                <h5>Color</h5>
            </div>
            <p class="entryP">
                I don't think my color usage is something that I would put
                into production on real products I develop. I do like color
                for my personal projects because it helps visual distinguish
                different focus points on screen. Using the muted colors
                also prevents the color from becoming distracting and
                drawing attention away from what the user is actually trying
                to accomplish on screen. My color choice is an attempt to
                create a forest theme.

                <h5>Button Placement</h5>
            </div>
            <p class="entryP">
                I placed the exit button in red on the bottom right of the
                program for a specific reason. I recently completed a UX
                class and had to submit a website I developed for review by
                peers. No one that reviewed my website ever found the
                question mark icon at the bottom right of the page that
                would have led them to the FAQ page. I did color the
                question mark blue, so I want to determine if it was color
                or button location that led people to not see it. Other than
                wanting to experiment with this idea, I don't particularly
                like the location of the exit button.
            </p>

            <p class="entryP">
                I wanted the add, modify, and delete buttons to resemble the
                old game boy start and select buttons. I think I got the
                shape close but the color of the original buttons are too
                dark to work with black text so I chose to just utilize the
                shape.

            <p class="entryP">
                Next I want to work on getting the add buttons to
                successfully open a new window and display a new styled page
                for adding parts and adding products. This will be my first
                time working with Event handlers and opening new windows.

                I finished the project about a week ago. I had some bugs to work out in validation and that
                caused the final submission of the project back longer than I had intended. However, it was a
                good experience in debugging and gave me perspective on the level of diligence required to
                anticipate potential problems and implement solutions to mitigate eliminate. I also ended up
                formatting the columns on the table to display product and part price columns in currency
                format.

            </div>
            <p class="entryP">
                This caused me a problem when using the search function for the parts and products. When a search would return a null result it would throw an exception and break the runtime.  Originally I had the code for formatting the price columns in the initialize method for the main screen controller.  However after encountering the search bug I determined it would be better to create a method to handle the column formatting.  In the method I placed a conditional that would return if the result set for the search was empty.  This prevents the column formatter from attempting to format an empty table.

                <h4>Add/Modify Part Form</h4>
            </div>
            <p class="entryP">
                The add and modify part forms were the easiest for me to handle.  Text fields to collect user input on parts with radio buttons to choose which type of part that is being modified or created. An id is automatically generated when the user clicks the save button.
